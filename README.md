## Running the project

To have the project fully functioning, the backend and frontend must be running at the same time.

###Back-end (ML Model)

All python packages must also be installed to have the fully functioning project as well.

Packages used:
mediapipe (Requires compatible python version)
opencv-python

Once all packages are installed, run the command:

Then,

npm install 

to install required packages.
then, run the command

Then, the front end should be running.
